I recommend printing out the player mat if you get the PNP version to make it easier to track which weapons are equipped</p>\n<p>GAMEFOUND VERSION</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Dungeon crawler</p>\n<p>Pick two dungeon cards and pick one, if you don't like the first card then you can push your luck and pick the other card</p>\n<p>Dungeon cards can often have 2 effects depending on which order the card was picked. Avoiding the first card you picked can be disaterous if you flip over a skirmish</p>\n<p>Combat is dice based with your damage impacted by equipment and skills. This combat is very simplistic but is only part of the gameplay\r\nThe card that triggers the combat will impact enemy health and initial damage meaning that choosing the fight if your first dungeon card is a combat encounter can the difference between life and death</p>\n<p>There are many other encounters during in the dungeon such as merchants, campsites. This means you never know what will be behind the card. An issue I had with another small dungeon crawler One Deck Dungeon</p>\n<p>Continue until all dungeon cards discarded</p>\n<p>Continue onto next level of dungeon, flip over a plot card\r\nThese plot cards give choices with many possible impacts. Each plot card has a value, once you have discarded enough plot cards to sum 10 or more you then encounter the boss</p>\n<p>The boss is picked based upon the enemies you fought during the dungeon. Bosses are just enemies with higher stats</p>\n<p>I generally found the game quite hard with enemies able to inflict large amounts of damage in a single hit and easy to run out of energy if you get to aggressive with attacks</p>\n<p>If you kill a boss you can end the game there and score based upon what you achieved. There are expansions available that you play after completing a dungeon keeping the same character as before allowing for campaign gameplay.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Iron Helm Review","date":"April 30, 2023","description":"Iron Helm is a fantastic solo dungeon crawler in a fairly small package.","tags":["Board Games","Review","Solo Review","Highly Recommend","Solo Only","Print and Play"],"pros":["Great dungeon crawling in a small package","Print and plays well","Multiple expansions","Win/Loss along with point scoring gives good replayability","Expansions for additional post game dungeons gives opportunity campaign playthroughs"],"cons":["Combat mechanics feel undercooked","Plot cards become repetitive quickly without expansions","Often came across cards that used morality even though I had not had the chance to increase/decrease my morality yet","Instructions aren't the best with the appendix being essential"],"review":"Highly Recommended","buy_links":["Print and Play: https://www.pnparcade.com/products/iron-helm","Physical: https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/iron-helm"],"conclusion":"TBC Sum of its parts, combat is very simple but when combined with all the other mechanics it comes together to give the feeling of dungeon crawling."},"fields":{"slug":"/iron_helm/"}},"relatedPosts":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"1ebbef8b-f681-54a1-ab65-3ca857e305c8","frontmatter":{"title":"Galdor's Grip","date":"April 30, 2023","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/344a73ea1adf376e3f3d4dd0ece3fc04/8295c/galdors.jpg"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/galdors_grip/"}}},{"node":{"id":"38622a11-3ff2-5f3c-bb66-6754b130cbc8","frontmatter":{"title":"Death Valley + Expansion Review (Solo Mode)","date":"April 30, 2023","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/5359fdb8bdb63231476b7be7dd6ff951/b3a76/deathvalley.png"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/death_valley/"}}},{"node":{"id":"b0b580d0-80c2-54a3-8f72-9c53abd6fd6a","frontmatter":{"title":"Sprawlopolis + Expansions Review (Solo Mode)","date":"May 01, 2023","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/dc462c999ab0d4b65b8b027e26121fcf/b3a76/sprawlopolis.png"}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/sprawlopolis/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"943a52d7-0fb1-5c94-9a36-048348bcabae","slug":"/iron_helm/","relatedPosts":["/death_valley/","/sprawlopolis/","/galdors_grip/"],"previousPostId":"e79da2a4-55cc-5eaa-b638-4c61f3bb7a9d","nextPostId":"180f1d6e-48ca-5d6f-b107-13d8d37aa11b"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2792332655","2841359383","688023903"],"slicesMap":{}}
