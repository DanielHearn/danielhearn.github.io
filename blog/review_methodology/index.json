I also print and play games so for games that I\r\nhave printed I will not review the quality of the components other than\r\nthe art.</p>\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <b>Highly Recommended:</b> These are games I would recommend to nearly\r\n    everyone regardless of price. Closest number rating would be 8-10/10.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <b>Recommended:</b> These are games I would recommend buying once you\r\n    are satisfied with the highly recommended games. This may include\r\n    games that I think are good but slightly overpriced. Closest number\r\n    rating would be 7-8/10.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <b>Pick up on Sale:</b> These are games I would recommend picking up\r\n    only on sale as they can be good experiences, but don't offer as good\r\n    value or fun as recommended or highly recommended games. Closest\r\n    number rating would be 6-7/10.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <b>Do Not Recommend:</b> These are games I would not recommend\r\n    regardless of price, due to unfun or broken gameplay. Closest number\r\n    rating would be 0-6/10.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>","hidden":false}
