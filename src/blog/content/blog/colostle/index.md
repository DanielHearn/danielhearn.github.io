cons:
  [
    "No guided story in the base game, so starting off on your first game might be more difficult as you have yet to be immersed in the world",
    "Lack of complex or stat based combat might put some off",
    "Limited descriptions of biomes and locations in the base game making you use more of your imagination. While roomlands adds more to help worldbuilding",

conclusion: "Colostle is a great solo journaling game. Providing just enough theming and atmosphere for you to make up the context to connect everything together. The large rooms in an endless castle works well for providing a unique setting while the rest being somewhat medieval fantasy with magic. Making both exploration and combat satisfying and fun."

Bought digital version of colostle from the [official store](https://www.colostle.com/product-page/colostle-digital-content-pack) for £8, then printed it.

I had yet to find a solo journaling game that really worked for me, until I tried Colostle.

### Official Description

_Colostle is a rulebook and setting for an adventure in the impossible roomlands of the Colostle, a castle so huge that whole continents, oceans and mountain ranges sit within its rooms. Use a standard deck of playing cards and check your draws against prompts and rules in the book to see what you discover on your adventures, and then write of your exploits and legend in a journal._

### Components

Playing Colostle requires a journal and a deck of generic playing cards, though using their deck is more thematic. I preferred this as you receive a printable deck after buying the digital version with simple yet expressive art.

### Gameplay

Gameplay involves exploration potentially followed by a combat phase depending on the result of the exploration. This is a continuous loop until you decide to finish or your character is killed. Your overarching goal for your journey is generally based upon your character’s calling which is randomly chosen or decided upon during character creation. This gives a general aim, though it isn’t always relevant during every exploration phase.

The class you pick adds a theming to your character and helps build your backstory. But also changes how many cards you can draw during exploration and combat. A high exploration class will have more things happen during exploration such as locations, events, people etc. You are free to interpret the cards however you like in any order, such as a village being attacked by a rook or a village inside of a rook. This helps guide the gameplay while letting you use your imagination. Each card has tables describing what they mean with different impacts depending on the card colour. Some cards might have additional cards drawn, such as items.

Combat is fairly simple, which may put off players expecting more complex and challenging combat. Enemies will draw a certain number of cards and you draw cards based on your combat level. Then you need to play one of your cards to counter the next card the enemy plays, this is ideally a higher value card to win that fight. If you lose combat you take a wound against your exploration or combat level. If either reaches zero then that character has been killed.This does add some danger to your adventures, but I generally found it easy to heal wounds and avoid combat during exploration.

Throughout your adventures you will find many rooms with various biomes and locations. Including villages, cities, oceans and whatever your mind can come up with. Cities provide shops, the hunters guild, homes and many useful amenities.

So far this is the only solo TTRPG that I’ve been able to get into. I think its mainly due to the focus on world building without complicated mechanics, letting your imagination run wild based on simple prompts from your cards.

### Settlements

### Battlements

### Roomlands Expansion

Roomlands is the first of many expansions, but will be covered in a separate review. It adds new classes, locations, a named city and a guided story. It is a great addition but I would recommend playing some of the base game first before picking this up.

### Jobs Expansions

Three jobs are currently available via separate job decks available to buy or print. These jobs don’t impact your class but add unique mechanics for cartography, inventing and researching. These will spice up your adventure but again I would recommend playing some of the base game first before picking this up.

### Colostle Patreon

There is a patreon available for £2 a month, with monthly posts adding new art, locations and all kinds of content to aid in your Colostle adventure. This content is often part of the next expansion so it acts as a way to see what is coming up while being in bite sized pieces.

### Multiplayer

While the base game does not support multiplayer, the Roomlands Expansion includes a 2-player module that I have not tried.

### Conclusion
