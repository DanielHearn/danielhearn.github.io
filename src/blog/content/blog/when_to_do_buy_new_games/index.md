As someone new to the hobby I've found it difficult to decide when to buy new games. There are so many recommendations and "essential" games it can be very easy to quickly overbuy. Many people use monthly board game budgets but that results in the urge that you need to buy new games each month.

Personally I've tried to use satisfaction in my games to decide when it's ok to buy new games where I wait until I've got satisfaction equal to the game's value on over 75% of my games. Though I have a different slightly different approach to print and play games due to the low costs, but I still try to play my previous printed games a few times before printing new games.

In conclusion based upon my current experience I think having a board game purchase limit per month, but avoiding using that as a requirement to keep buying. Along with only buying games you know you will like without being too swayed by other's recommendations.
