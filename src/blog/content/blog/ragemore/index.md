pros:
  [
    "Print and Plays well",
    "Great art",
    "Balancing avoiding the multiple loss conditions feels good",
  ]
cons:
  [
    "Limited replayability as I felt finished with the game once I had won a few times",

    "My strategy to win was consistently available even with random card draws",

conclusion: "Rage feels underbaked, the amount of choices per turn in theory gives room for complexity but the strategy I found for winning ended up being consistently usable. The result is a game that feels like it needed an extra mechanic to feel fun after 5 games."
