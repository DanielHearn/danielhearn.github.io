review: "Pick Up On Sale"
pros:
  [
    "Print and Plays well",
    "Great art",
    "Balancing avoiding the multiple loss conditions feels good",
  ]
cons:
  [
    "Limited replayability as I felt finished with the game once I had won a few times",
    "Feels like it needed additional difficulty modes or mechanics",
    "My strategy to win was consistently available even with random card draws",

  ]
conclusion: "Ragemore feels underbaked, in theory the amount of choices per turn gives room for complexity but the strategy I found for winning ended up being consistently usable. The result is a game that feels like it needed an extra mechanic to still feel fun after 5 games."

I reviewed the print and play version from [PNP Arcade](https://www.pnparcade.com/collections/solo-games/products/ragemore) for $3.

### Official Description

_Ragemore is an 18 card solo game where you will complete quests, while managing your hand and resources as you delve though the dark, fighting demons, all in a span of 10-15 minutes._
