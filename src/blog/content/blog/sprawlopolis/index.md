review: "Highly Recommended"
pros:
  [
    "Massively replayable with 816 scoring combinations",
    "Easy to pick up and play",
    "Expansions are small but add additional complexity (not all are great though)",
    "Active solo challenges on the Button Shy Games community discord",
    "Very good value",
    "Simple mechanics but with surprising depth",
  ]
cons:
  [
    "Some scoring combinations are much easier or harder than others, making some combinations unfun",
    "Co-op mode is not well designed as you just work together by taking turns without showing your cards",
  ]

conclusion: "Sprawlopolis is fantastic as a solo game with simple gameplay that manages to have plenty of depth with very little. Random scoring goals adds so much replayability making it one of the best value Button Shy Games. Though the multiplayer is lackluster so I would recommend trying purpose built multiplayer Button Shy Games if you want it for that."

I reviewed the [Quined Games](http://xmedia.quined.nl/shop/sprawlopolis/) version that I bought from [Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/product/sprawlopolis/).
