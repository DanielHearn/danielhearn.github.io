WIP REVIEW

// SETUP PICK

// PROGRESS PIC

// END PIC

// SOLO CHALLENGE EXAMPLE + DISCORD LINK

// EXPANSIONS, NOT FULLY REVIEWED

PROS:

- Massively replayable 816 scoring combinations
- Easy to pick up and clear away
- Expansions are small but add additional complexity (not all are great though)
- Active solo community challenges on the button shy discord
- Usually cheap I got the Quined Games boxed version for only Â£9
- Can choose to play quicker or slower depending on how far you want to plan ahead

CONS:

- Some scoring combinations are much easier or harder than others, making some combinations unfun
- Co-op mode is not well designed as you just takes turns without showing your cards to avoid alpha gamers

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
