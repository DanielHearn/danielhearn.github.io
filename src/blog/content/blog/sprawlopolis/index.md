review: "HIGHLY_RECOMMENDED"
pros:
  [
    "Massively replayable 816 scoring combinations",
    "Easy to pick up and clear away",
    "Expansions are small but add additional complexity (not all are great though)",
    "Active solo community challenges on the button shy discord",
    "Very good value",
    "Can choose to play quicker or slower depending on how far you want to plan ahead",
  ]
cons:
  [
    "Some scoring combinations are much easier or harder than others, making some combinations unfun",
    "Co-op mode is not well designed as you just takes turns without showing your cards to avoid alpha gamers",

I reviewed the [Quined Games](http://xmedia.quined.nl/shop/sprawlopolis/) version that I bought from [Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/product/sprawlopolis/).
