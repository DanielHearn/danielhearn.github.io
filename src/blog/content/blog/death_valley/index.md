WIP REVIEW

![Death Valley](./deathvalley.png)

// PNP VERSION

PROS:

- Great art
- Different theme
- Tableau building with opportunity for good combos
- Consistent playtime makes it great to fit in during lunch
- PNP well
- Panamint City expansion adds extra variety as you can swap out cards from the base game

CONS:

- Limited cards overall and number of cards per suite can make some tableau combinations rare or difficult to aim for. Only 3 animals makes them difficult to play together as they can get split up between both players.
- Lacks the complexity of other button shy/18 card games due to limited mechanics from each card
- Only one expansion means less replayability

RECOMMENDED
