conclusion: "Death Valley is great as a solo tableau builder, with push your luck that gives tension when drawing from the deck. Pulling off combos feels satisying though the limited number of cards and mechanics impacts the replayability and possible options."

I reviewed the print and play version from [PNP Arcade](https://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley) for $3.

Death valley comes with 2 multiplayer modes and a solo mode that is the focus of this review. The bot in the solo mode is easy to use an helps give the game a very consistent play length making it a great choice for lunchtimes.

You shuffle and draw deck and play the top card as a faceup desert card. In each turn you can choose between playing the top facedown card from the deck or the desert card into your journey. Your journey contains cards you can score from but you have to be careful to avoid busting by having 3 cards of the same type, this causes you to clear your journey of cards and put the card that caused the bust into your discard pile. The other option is to rest by moving a card from your journey into your scrapbook to keep it safe as they cannot be lost due to busting with the downside of scrapbook cards not scoring for stars. This gives great push your luck where busting can cause huge consequences. You can also hide journey cards when resting while plays into certain combos while allowing you to avoid busting by hiding cards with duplicated types.
