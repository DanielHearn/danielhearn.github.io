![Iron Helm cards](./iron_helm.png)

I reviewed the Print and Play version available from PNP Arcade for $5. But only some expansions are available for print and play.

### Official Description

_Iron Helm is a solo-play dungeon crawler in which you play as a hero in search of one last major score before finally hanging up the sword and retiring._

### Components

PNP has cards but you can either make your own tokens or print out the card trackers from BGG with your own cubes to track, I prefered this to making all the tokens (I still had to make blessing tokens). I recommend printing out the player mat if you get the PNP version to make it easier to track which weapons are equipped. I didn't see a need in printing the gameplay mat.

GAMEFOUND VERSION

### Gameplay

// TODO
Dungeon crawler in a fairly small package

// TODO
Pick character and start with the skills and trappings assigned to that character, along with the health, energy, rations listed on the character card. Each plays differently with the biggest impact being the main type of skills the character can upgrade with for cheaper.

Play two facedown dungeon cards and pick one and flip it face up, if you don't like the first card then you can push your luck and pick the other card.

Dungeon cards can often have 2 effects depending on which order the card was picked with the second effect being stronger. Avoiding the first card you picked can be disaterous if you flip over a skirmish. This gives great push your luck gameplay.

Combat is dice based with your damage impacted by equipment and skills. This combat is very simplistic but is only part of the gameplay
The card that triggers the combat will impact enemy health and initial damage meaning that choosing the fight if your first dungeon card is a combat encounter can the difference between life and death

There are many other encounters during in the dungeon such as merchants, campsites. This means you never know what will be behind the card. An issue I had with another small dungeon crawler One Deck Dungeon.

// TODO
Continue until all dungeon cards discarded

// TODO
Continue onto next level of dungeon, flip over a plot card
These plot cards give choices with many possible impacts. Each plot card has a value, once you have discarded enough plot cards to sum 10 or more you then encounter the boss. The dungeon cards are reshuffled, a ration is reduced and potion is increased if you have it. This means you need to keep resources available as running out will be dangerous. The dungeon tracker card is used to track which level of the dungeon you are on.

The boss is picked based upon the enemies you fought during the dungeon. Bosses are just enemies with higher stats so combat is played as normal.

I generally found the game quite hard with enemies able to inflict large amounts of damage in a single hit and easy to run out of energy if you get too aggressive with attacks.

### Game End

If you kill a boss you can end the game there and score based upon what you achieved. There are expansions available that you play after completing a dungeon keeping the same character as before allowing for campaign gameplay.

### Expansions

The Loot and Lore pack adds new characters, plot cards, enemies and items. This is combined with a base game to expand its content. I found this really improved the content variety.

Additional adventure expansions are also available to add campaign gameplay. These adventures are brought into the game after completing a certain number of previous dungeons. Each adventure has a new boss, enemies, character and items. 6 are available on gamecrafter though only 4 are currently on PNP arcade.

There is also the Iron Chest expansion https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/iron-chest which is only available physically. This adds a new adventure pack, mechanics, items, and random encounters. I've yet to try this expansion due to the cost of importing games from The Game Crafter into the UK.
