![Iron Helm cards](./iron_helm.png)

I reviewed the Print and Play version for $5

### Official Description

### Components

PNP has cards but you can either make your own tokens or print out the card trackers from BGG with your own cubes to track, I prefered this to making all the tokens (I still had to make blessing tokens). I recommend printing out the player mat if you get the PNP version to make it easier to track which weapons are equipped

GAMEFOUND VERSION

### Gameplay

Dungeon crawler

Pick two dungeon cards and pick one, if you don't like the first card then you can push your luck and pick the other card

Dungeon cards can often have 2 effects depending on which order the card was picked. Avoiding the first card you picked can be disaterous if you flip over a skirmish

Combat is dice based with your damage impacted by equipment and skills. This combat is very simplistic but is only part of the gameplay
The card that triggers the combat will impact enemy health and initial damage meaning that choosing the fight if your first dungeon card is a combat encounter can the difference between life and death

There are many other encounters during in the dungeon such as merchants, campsites. This means you never know what will be behind the card. An issue I had with another small dungeon crawler One Deck Dungeon

Continue until all dungeon cards discarded

Continue onto next level of dungeon, flip over a plot card
These plot cards give choices with many possible impacts. Each plot card has a value, once you have discarded enough plot cards to sum 10 or more you then encounter the boss

The boss is picked based upon the enemies you fought during the dungeon. Bosses are just enemies with higher stats

I generally found the game quite hard with enemies able to inflict large amounts of damage in a single hit and easy to run out of energy if you get to aggressive with attacks

### Game End

If you kill a boss you can end the game there and score based upon what you achieved. There are expansions available that you play after completing a dungeon keeping the same character as before allowing for campaign gameplay.
