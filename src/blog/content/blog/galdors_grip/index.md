![Galdor's Grip cards](./galdors.jpg)

Great theme only via card names and art

Only available as print and play. But was easy to print and has crosshair markers

### Components

Cards, all played in hand. Each card has great art with a name.

Value showing the number of cards that will be moved from the top to the bottom of the deck

Some cards can be flipped to get different effects or values

### Gameplay

All cards are face down at the start. Then you flip over the top card and resolve any effects. Next you move the specified number of cards to the bottom of the deck based upon the value of the top card. You can move the top card anywhere within the segment of cards being moved which is the main choice you need to make to win. Bad card orders can mean you miss flipping over face down cards or visiting negative cards. Being able to view the face up cards in the deck makes it easy to plan ahead.

The aim is to get 9 stars by the end of the game, these stars are earnt by having face up cards with stars on the top side. Cards with stars often require achieving certain orders of cards within the deck.

You also have to avoid repeatedly have the figment of feragot cards at the top of the deck. If this happens to the same of these cards three times then you automatically lose. Though flipping over these cards twice can earn a star so you can push your luck. I often found it quite hard to get nine stars with my average being 5 or 6.

### Expansions

Galdor's Grip has three expansions each containing 6 cards that can replace cards from the base game. This gives great replayability.
