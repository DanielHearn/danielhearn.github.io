While I use a an x out of 10 review system on BoardGameGeek, here I
instead classify games as: Highly Recommended, Recommended, Pick up on
Sale, Do Not Recommend. I also print and play games so for games that I
have printed I will not review the quality of the components other than
the art.

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Highly Recommended:</b> These are games I would recommend to nearly
    everyone regardless of price. Closest number rating would be 8-10/10.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Recommended:</b> These are games I would recommend buying once you
    are satisfied with the highly recommended games. This may include
    games that I think are good but slightly overpriced. Closest number
    rating would be 7-8/10.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pick up on Sale:</b> These are games I would recommend picking up
    only on sale as they can be good experiences, but don't offer as good
    value or fun as recommended or highly recommended games. Closest
    number rating would be 6-7/10.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Do Not Recommend:</b> These are games I would not recommend
    regardless of price, due to unfun or broken gameplay. Closest number
    rating would be 0-6/10.
  </li>
</ul>
