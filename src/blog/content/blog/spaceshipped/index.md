pros:
  [
    "Achieves the theme's mechanics with only 18 cards",
    "Print and Plays well",
    "Choices for riskier plays or longer plays that might risk to losing to the enemy",
    "Great multi use cards that packs lots of gameplay into very little",
  ]
cons:
  [
    "Balance, some upgrades statistically worse than others",
    "Randomness can suddenly end the game without any notice and time to prepare",
    "Some games can drag on due to poor market cards, resulting in inconsistent game lengths",
  ]
review: "Recommended"

conclusion: "Spaceshipped is great but flawed, the game feels like a space merchant adventure with very little. But the randomness really reduces the potential fun and could be easily improved with a few tweaks to the damage numbers."

I reviewed the print and play version from [PNP Arcade](https://www.pnparcade.com/products/spaceshipped) for $3.
