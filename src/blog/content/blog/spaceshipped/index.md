WIP REVIEW

![SpaceShipped](./spaceshipped.png)

// PNP VERSION
// SOLO only

PROS:

- Achieves the theme's mechanics with only 18 cards
- PNP well
- Choices for riskier plays or longer plays that might risk to losing to the enemy
- Many expansions for variety and additional complexity

CONS:

- Balance, some upgrades seem worse than others even when considering different builds
- Randomness can suddenly destroy your ship and end the game without any notice and time to prepare. Orbital encounters have no warning but can cause 3 damage (your ship without shields only has 3 health). These can combo with planetside encounters to cause additional unavoidable damage without expert navigator

RECOMMENDED
