conclusion: "The Royal Limited manages to edge out the many decent but repetitive Button Shy Games with some simple yet clever mechanics that feels very satisfying to win. While the two current expansions add some additional variety and complexity I feel that the games system can be easily expanded and rethemed for mechanical variety like the ‘opolis games."

![The Royal Limited Cards](./the_royal_limited_spread.jpg)

I reviewed the print and play version from [PNP Arcade](https://www.pnparcade.com/products/the-royal-limited-1) for $3.

I made many Button Shy Games from the 2023 Black Friday sales with The Royal Limited and Food Chain Island quickly becoming my favourite.

### Official Description

_TThe Royal Limited is a solo game about building your train and filling it up with passengers and VIPs before the train departs. Use cards from your hand to add new cars and place passengers to occupy them. Match symbols and colors to ensure everyone aboard is satisfied, especially the VIPs! Make the most of your line and see if you can live up to the grand expectations of The Royal Limited._

### Components

Another Button Shy Game with good production value with the standard 18 cards. These represent train carriages and the passengers on them, with dual sided VIP cards acting as a key objective, finally a four sided turn timer card is used to count down towards scoring.

CARD PICS

### Gameplay

The Royal Limited is a solo game themed around building a filling a 1960’s English train with passengers. Your aim is to use as many cards as possible within the train so that at best you have zero unused cards, though I certainly found that difficult.

SETUP

To set up you shuffle the train cards into a deck, set the turn timer to green and randomly pick two VIP cards. The VIPs act as the main source of variety with additional complexity in how the two of them might interfere or combo with each other similarly to the ‘opolis games’ scoring cards.

FIRST TURN

Starting the first turn involves drawing 5 cards from the train deck, this turn will continue until you can no longer place any cards from your hand or a train carriage ability cannot be achieved, resulting in the next turn being triggered. Placing a train carriage requires discarding a number of cards from your hand equal to the train carriage value. Adjacent carriages must be different colours and numbers, with carriages only getting added to the right side.

PASSENGER

Placing a passenger requires an empty carriage with the same colour and/or number. But doing so triggers the ability of that carriage, which can be good or bad. Generally the higher value carriages have benefits while the low value carriages will punish you by discard cards from your hand or similar negatives. Some may even trigger adjacent carriages, letting you build combos if you think that far ahead. These mechanics provide good decisions as evaluating the tradeoff using low cost carriages now might make passenger placement easier now, but hurt you long-term.

VIP PLACEMENT

While filling empty carriages with passengers is important to get the best score, focusing on planning your VIP placement is best. Due to them requiring specific requirements such as adjacent passenger values or colours. Getting these placed requires good planning and sometimes luck if you don't know which cards are left in the deck. Maybe your VIP needs to be placed between even value passengers but you already used most of your even numbers in earlier turns, or a VIP needs to be placed in the middle carriage but you had to fill it with a passenger due to a carriage ability. This mechanic is definitely where the best puzzle satisfaction comes from. With ten VIPs and only two chosen at once, there is decent variety though many of the VIP requirements aren’t particularly interesting and just odd/even flipped versions of themselves. Hopefully they can expand on the VIP requirements in the future expansions.

When you are unable to play cards from your hand and cannot play a VIP then the train timer is turned 90 degrees, this acts as your turn timer over four turns. When it hits the train leaving the station marker the last turn begins with the scoring triggering after.

FINISH + SCORING

Winning requires having only a few points left at the end of the game.Points are gained by having VIP cards, discarded cards and empty carriages. Having different remaining points will give a different score level with 0 points being the best. I found it very difficult to get 0 points and would often still lose with 3 or 4 points in some plays. But this meant that there were difficult decisions in potentially leaving unused cards to go into discard after a turn but later bring them back via an ability.

### Murder On Board Expansion

MURDER CARDS

While this expansion only includes three new cards I was surprised at how much complexity it adds. The game is set up as normal but now you have a detective card that will travel between train carriages based on the value of passengers you place. Reminding me a lot of the programming style gameplay in Fishing Lessons. You also put the undiscovered victim card with the left VIP and the undiscovered murderer with the right VIP. These are your objectives to reach with the detective as you must first place and reach the victim with the detective while still playing the standard rules. This discovers the murder victim, letting you now discover the murderer by again placing the other VIP and moving the detective to that train carriage. While using this expansion the standard scoring rules apply but to win you must discover the victim and murderer in order, otherwise you lose.

MURDER START

MURDER FIND VICTIM

MURDER FIND MURDERER

This expansion really upped the complexity and requires a lot of forethought as you need to plan both the standard placement mechanics and the detective’s movement. Many times I got stuck with carriage values that made the detective’s movements in the last two turns impossible due to overuse of identical value cards earlier in the game. I highly recommend this expansion for this complexity boost and good use of theming that makes it seem designed from the start the game’s inception rather than the mediocre content expansions often released for Button Shy Games.

### Second Line Expansion

SECOND LINE CARDS

This expansion includes four new train carriage cards as you now need to build a second train alongside your first. It keeps it simple by increasing the number of drawn cards per turn to 6 and requiring both trains be at most one card length difference in length to win at the end of the game. It also introduces wild train carriages and passengers that have no value. I think this adds some complexity but lacks the imagination of the Murder On Board expansion, but it seems worth it to add additional replayability after ten to twenty plays of the base game.

SECOND LINE FINISH

### Conclusion
